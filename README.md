**Project Description:**

The project aims to create a system for managing student information, including personal details and academic performance. It will calculate cutoff marks based on specific criteria, save the data to a MongoDB database, and send email notifications containing student marks and cutoff scores. The system will be developed using React.js for the frontend, Node.js with the Express framework for the backend, and MongoDB for the database.

**Installation Instructions:**

**1.	Frontend (React.js):**

**Step:1**  Clone the project repository from Git.

**Step:2**  Navigate to the frontend directory (cd frontend).

**Step:3**  Manually install dependencies: **npm install**

**Step:4**  Start the development server: **npm start**

**2.	Backend (Node.js with Express):**

     •	Navigate to the backend directory **(cd backend)**.

     •	Manually install dependencies: **npm install**.

     •	Build the project for staging: npm run build_stage.


**3.	Database (MongoDB):**

     • Use the **MongoDB connection string from your cd/backend/.env file** to connect to the **MongoDB Atlas cluster**.

**Project Deployment:**

Once the project is built and configured locally, it can be deployed to a hosting service such as Heroku for public access. Ensure to set up environment variables and configuration files properly for deployment.

**Note:** Make sure to replace placeholders like database credentials, email server details, and any sensitive information with actual values before deployment to ensure security and proper functioning of the application.
